This is an unofficial Groupme bot that you can use 
in conjuction with a Madden league on Daddyleagues. 

There are actually 2 bots. 1 for the main groupme, 
and 1 for an admin groupme. They use mostly the same
code, but the admin bot adds a couple of commands.

\*\*alias: you have the ability to add an alias to any command. For example, 
"advance" is stored in the "info" portion of the xml. To display it, you can 
send "?info advance" or just "?advance" normall (and assuming "?" is the prefix.
But maybe you want to be able to just send "?adv" or "?sim" instead. You can set 
it up that way! In the chat with the admin bot, just send "?set alias adv info 
advance" or "?set alias adv advance", either way will work.

My next task is to refactor some of the code and add the ability to register users 
and user groups.
